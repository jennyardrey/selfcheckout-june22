# June 2022 Self Checkout Mob Programming Exercise

## Steps for setting up:

- Make a new directory for you project
- Open the directory in VS Code
- Create some file. You will need one for your functions, a place for you tests, and somewhere to keep your data.
- initiate the project as a node project using ```npm init```. This will add a package.json file and allow us to install Jest. Remember when you install Jest, install it as a dev dependency!
- Set your 'test' script to run Jest.
- Run ```npm test``` to check everything is in working order.
- Now you are ready to go! Don't forget to use TDD!

## User stories:

1. As a user, I would like to be able to scan an item using it's barcode so it's details can be found from the products list

2. As a user, I would like to be able to add an item to my basket.

3. As a user, I would like to be able to see the total price of all items in my basket.

4. As a user, I would like to be able to remove an item from my basket.   

You can see an example repo here:

On the example repo, there are three branches. One written using functions (as we did in class), one using a plain object, and one using a class. We will be looking at classes in our upcoming sessions!
